# A-VR-Maze

Built a VR application using Unity and the Google VR SDK where the user explores a maze environment to demonstrate working knowledge of 2D and 3D UI, waypoint based navigation, procedural animation, interactive objects, spatial audio, particle effects and persistent storage of session data.

Took around 9 hr to complete
;What I like: building model of the maze
;What challenging: scripting for the key and door. 
;It is overwhelming for people who don't have coding background.
